// Peer Reviewer and Comments: It looks pretty good for desktop, however there are some alignment problems, such as the reserve portion with the inputs and check availability's padding. For responsiveness for tablet, the room cards are a bit squished/congested? Other than that, there is responsiveness for mobile. I liked how you you changed it to an offcanvas navbar for med/sm. -Halley Pham
